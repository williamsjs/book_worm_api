# Book Worm API

I'm writing this API so that I can keep notes on various non-fiction books I've been reading.  

## Dependencies:
* Postgres -
  <br />run `brew install postgres` to install postgres locally,
  <br /> then run `brew services start postgres` to start the server

Details:

* Ruby version - 2.4.2
